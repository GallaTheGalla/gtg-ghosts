	<p>This page includes various rules and requests related to works found on this website. If terms on this page conflict with those found in a work's readme.txt or other documentation, then the terms here take priority, <u>except in the case of freeshells</u>. For questions, clarifications, or requests for permissions not covered here, I can be contacted through the social media links in the footer at the bottom of the page.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><u>"You Must":</u> These are things that are required when using my works.
	<li><u>"You May":</u> These are things that are optional when using my works.
